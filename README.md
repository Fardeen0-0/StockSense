# Stock Sense
An AI-powered financial analyst that predicts stock prices based on past years' data. The app uses Yahoo Finance to obtain training data and utilizes Prophet to run predictions and generate concise graphs. The app also uses Streamlit to generate a clean front end. Along with the graphs and predictions, it is also equipped with an interactive chatbot, powered by OpenAI, to provide additional assistance in topics regarding stock investments.\
This project was built by my team at the HackUmass '24 competition in a highly competitive environment in a limited timeframe. So a hearty kudos to my teammates for collaorating with me in building this beauty ;)

```
To start the app locally, run
